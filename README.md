# Project Proposal

## Project title
Shopping App

## What and why?
This proposed software is an online shopping application through which users can sell their (used or unused) merchandises and purchase merchandises sold by other users. Due to the ongoing pandemic, there are various barriers limiting people from shopping outside. In addition, many customers consider merchandises sold on official sites overpriced and prefer to buy cheaper ones from other individuals. Such problems are significant because they are a concern for almost anyone today. This system provides users a platform to trade with other individual users as well as companies to satisfy every user's need for product variety and meet every user's desired price range. The purchased merchandise is delivered to the door so customers can avoid going outside.

## For whom?
The product faces the mass consumer and merchants. Anyone who wants to shop online and anyone who intends to sell (including individuals and companies) can do so on this platform.

## How?
For a customer, the platform can show a variety of products' images and prices sold by others based on search conditions. Upon clicking on an image, the customer can see more details about this product such as sizing, color, and other buyers' comments. The customer has the option to purchase the product. Once purchased and the payment goes through successfully, the product will be mailed to the address the customer indicated when purchasing. For a seller, the platform allows uploading the information of a product to be sold. The seller can upload images, price and other information to put a product on the platform for customers to view. Once a customer purchases a product, the seller will ship the product to the indicated address through a shipping company.

## Scope
This software contains frontend and backend aspects. Throughout a semester, the UI/UX features can be implemented by 2-3 person. The storage of information and comments for products, which involves a database, and the searching and uploading features (database access) can be implemented by 3-4 people. Overall, the functions are within the capability of a 4-6 people team during one semester.
